# DigiHunt
Official app for DigiHunt game played at the Sanjay Ghodawat University, Kolhapur during the college TechFest 'VIBRANT 2K18'

# Description of the app
The app was the official app of the game which was used by all the teams and the participants who were playing that game.
The game was simple, we gave a digital look and feel to the traditonal and popular game known as the 'Treasure hunt' by storing the clues in qr-codes
rather than storing it away openly on a piece of paper.
This qr-codes would be then scanned onto my app and then the scanned code would give the participants their next clue.
Clues were feed into this app and there were around 400 to 500 clues in total and so playing this game without the app was impossible.

I provided one more feature in the app in which if a player exits the app by any reason he/she would be disqualified straight away there itself
without any further a do.
Also a warning message is also available if the user or the participant would try to exit the app.
